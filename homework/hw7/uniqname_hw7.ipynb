    "Code review is often a highly misunderstood skill. This is because code review requires the ability to put yourself in the position of someone else and think like they thought. As a reader, you have to make assumptions about what the code is doing and why it was doing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code review requires a fair bit of problem solving skills and even more understanding about the code. It is also through code review that we begin to develop our skillsets for creating informative variable names, meaningful inline comments and docstrings, and more organized code. This is because we often wish that the code we have read had these kinds of features.\n",
