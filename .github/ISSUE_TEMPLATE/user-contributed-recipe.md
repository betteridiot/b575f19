# Instructions and "As-Is Warranty"
Many times, users create helpful "recipes" that assist in performing complex or challenging computational tasks. These can take the form of a single function, a one-line generator expression, or multi-faceted class structures.

Therefore, we are allowing students that create these recipes a chance to share them with their classmates in a way that gives them a form of acknowledgment.

**However**, all end-users (e.g. other students) may use this recipe only under the express understanding that the recipe is provided ***AS-IS***. Therefore, all recipes provided fall under the license of this repository and its ["As-Is" warranty](https://github.com/betteridiot/b575f19/blob/master/LICENSE) described below:
> In no event shall the copyright holder or contributors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.

# Summary
Use this space to describe what your recipe does and how it does it in plain words. **No code**. If necessary, break it up into sections if your recipe is sufficiently large.

---
# I/O
Use this space to describe the coding contract required for your recipe to work. That is, describe what the input of the code (what does the code expect), and what the output of the  recipe is (what does the code produce)
