* The more information/context you provide, the better we (the instructors and class) can collectively assist you.

* Please fill out all of the relevant sections below. Incomplete questions will not be addressed by the instruction team. 

* Questions asked ***without*** showing an attempt to answer individually will also not be addressed.

* It is bad etiquette to ask things such as "I don't know how to do this, can you tell me how?" or "I can't get this code to work, what is wrong?" if you do not provide the context and/or screenshots necessary to 
help.
