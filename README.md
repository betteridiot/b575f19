### Updating your local repo
If you get an error when you `pull` (or update) the repo that says something like "Your local changes to the following files will be overwritten by mergeâ€™", you can do a `git stash` to address this. 

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/betteridiot/b575f19/wiki/Updating-your-local-repo) page that details how to update your local repo without overwritting your data. 

To find out more about `git stash`, go to https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing to read all about it.
